		description: `Our founder, Will, has always loved food. While living in New York and holding down a stressful job, this took an unhealthy turn. Will didn’t enjoy cooking for one - the reward didn’t justify the shopping, prepping and cooking. But eating out and taking shortcuts took a toll on his happiness and his waistline. Getting back into healthy food habits gave Will the power to transform his life. The secret? Eating fresh pre-prepared meals that didn’t compromise on ingredients, flavour or nutrition. When he moved back to the UK, Will couldn’t find a service anything like as good as he was used to - so he started Tastily.`,

Our chefs’ skill is making fantastic food that tastes great and does you good everyday. We push the boundaries of pre-made meals, creating food that’s ready for you to bring to perfection in just 3 minutes. Every dish is made fresh to order - we’re looking forward to cooking yours!`,

We use quality ingredients, locally sourced where possible, and at least 2 servings of veg per portion. When the food tastes this good, it's easy to build good food habits.
